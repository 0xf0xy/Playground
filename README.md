<h1 align="center">Welcome to my Playground</h1>

<br>

## 🧠 About
This repo is a collection of small personal projects, tests, scripts, and prototypes. Nothing fancy, just code I write for fun, practice, or exploration.

<br>

## 🔍 What's inside?
You'll probably find things like:

- 🛠️ Tools and utilities I’m building or testing
- 💡 Concepts I’m learning and applying
- 🧰 Random scripts to automate stuff or solve small problems

<br>

## 🤸 Why "Playground"?
Because sometimes the best way to learn is by playing around — no rules, no pressure, just curiosity.

<br>

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a **personal sandbox**. Code may be messy, half-broken, or incomplete.  
Use at your own risk.
