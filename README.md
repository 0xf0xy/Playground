## > About

This repository serves as a personal workspace.

It contains small projects, experiments, scripts, and prototypes created for:
- testing ideas
- learning new concepts
- exploring tools, techniques, and workflows

Nothing here is polished.  
Everything here is intentional.

> **Disclaimer:** Code may be incomplete, unstable, or abandoned.  
> Use it as reference, not as production-ready software.
